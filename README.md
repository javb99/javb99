### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love to develop apps for Apple's platforms especially using Swift.

I've been using Swift heavily since swift 3 back in 2016.

I've built many hobby apps including:
- App to help schedulers using Planning Center Services know how many volunteers are still needed
- Chord chart generator app for macOS based on the chord pro format
- Functional clone of the streaming portion of the Apple TV app for my church
- Search engine for Swift Packages that I scraped from Github (Python)
- App to manage groups of contacts directly on iPhone to send group texts easier
